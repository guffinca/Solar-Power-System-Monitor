# Solar-Power-System-Monitor

Materials Needed:

    Arduino board
    Solar panel 
    Voltage Divider components (two resistors) 
    Breadboard and wires 
  

Circuit Connection:

    Connect postive terminal of Solar panel to one end of the First resistor (R1)
    Connect the other end of R1 to the analog input (A0) on the Arduino
    Connect junction point between R1 and R2 to the negative terminal of the solar panel
    Connect the other end of R2 to the ground (GND) of the Arduino
    Connect the ohter end of the solar panel to the 5V pin on the Arduino
